		<p>Technology leadership is a critical driver for hi-tech companies. New market entrants rely on technology leadership to build significantly differentiated products and services that can challenge incumbent players. At the same time, the incumbents rely on R&D to consolidate their leadership positions. Successful strategies in this race focus on technology innovation to engineer new products and services.</p>
		<p>At any given moment in time customers need a differentiating factor in the way technology is applied for their specific need. As technology is changing at rates never seen before, it requires constant focus and creativity to stay ahead and be ready to surf the next technology wave.</p>
